to run:

open terminal/command prompt

1. cd to this directory (ex: "cd user/desktop/server")
2. type "./compile.sh" (or copy and paste the entire file into the terminal window)
3. type "./main" to run the server

* server must be online before the client can run, so run this program first!
* note that if using a windows computer, you may need to change all forward slashes '/' to back slashes '\' in compile.sh
